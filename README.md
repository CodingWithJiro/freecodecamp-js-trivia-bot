A fun, single-page landing project featuring a themed ‚ÄúJS Trivia Bot‚Äù built with semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and interactive JavaScript. It demonstrates basic DOM manipulation with `console.log()` and toggles between light and dark modes using `localStorage` and the `prefers-color-scheme` media query.

Created as part of the lab challenges from [**freeCodeCamp.org**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/) JavaScript course.
